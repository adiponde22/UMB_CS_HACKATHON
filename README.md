# Stock Opening Price Predictor

The Stock Opening Price Predictor is a Python-based web application built with Streamlit that allows users to predict the future opening price of a stock using historical stock price data and a polynomial regression model. This application provides insights into stock price trends and offers predictions for the next day's opening price.

## Features

- Predicts the future opening price of a stock based on historical data.
- Displays historical price charts for the past five years.
- Provides key metrics and recommendations for the specified stock.
- Calculates and displays the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score to evaluate model accuracy.
